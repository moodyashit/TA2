        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Aclaro, Coleen N. I'm a Student of FEU - Alabang, I have 0 of experience in this kind of field.</p>
        <h2 id="section1"> About </h2>
        <p>I'm 18 years old, about to turn 19 on June 17. I love to read books, novels, mangas, manhwas, webtoons, etc. Currently, I haven't really delved into the comic side. I also like to play games and watch gameplays of games I'm interested in before playing them myself. Another thing about my interest in gaming is that I love to watch 100% gameplays where they get every achievement and item. And, I just love watching artistic people do something remarkably artistic. That's me.</p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>My skills... are quite literally nothing. Unless you count not caring for other people's opinions and ideas of me as a skill. I guess writing would be one? And if insulting can be called a skill, then maybe that too. I don't mind learning new things as long as they interest me.</p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>My interests are the same as my about me section. I have an interest in reading, writing, and living.</p>

      <p class="card-text"> This was my 2nd or 3rd html code that I made, well, not really made by myself. Our professor also
        made a template for us. So maybe made by me, was a bad take. But anyways, almost majority of the html codes I do is all
        beige themed. Or, minimalistic in a way. </p>

      <p class="card-text"> To be honest, not sure if this is my first or second html code. Since, when we first started
        our professor already taught us how to do html but, it's with her guidance. This one, was actually made
        by me entirely. I actually meant that for once.
